## Apollo: The Secure Foundation of Identus platform

Apollo is the robust cryptographic engine driving the security and privacy of Identus platform, a comprehensive suite of
blockchain-powered solutions. This collection of cryptographic methods provides the solid foundation upon which Identus
platform builds its diverse functionalities.

### Key Features of Apollo:

- **Hashing:** Cryptographically secure hashing functions, including the widely trusted SHA-2 family and PBKDF2SHA512,
  ensure data integrity and prevent tampering.
- **Base64 Encoding/Decoding:** This efficient encoding scheme allows secure transmission and storage of binary data.
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (Secp256k1):** This cutting-edge cryptographic algorithm provides robust digital
  signatures and key generation for secure transactions.
- **Secure Random Generation:** High-quality randomness is crucial for cryptographic processes, and Apollo employs
  advanced techniques to guarantee its integrity.
- **Key Derivation:** Securely deriving new cryptographic keys from existing ones enhances security and protects against
  key compromise.
- **Mnemonic Generation:** Transforming complex private keys into human-memorable phrases improves user experience and
  accessibility.
- **Hierarchical Deterministic Key Management (HDKey):** This powerful system allows generating a vast number of child
  keys from a single master key, facilitating robust key management for diverse applications.

## Security First:

Apollo's commitment to security is paramount. It has undergone two independent security audits, further validating its
reliability and trustworthiness. This meticulous attention to security ensures that Identus platform operates at the
highest standards, safeguarding user data and privacy.

## Empowering Secure Solutions:

Through its robust cryptographic capabilities, Apollo empowers Identus platform to deliver a range of secure and
privacy-preserving solutions across various industries. From identity management and document verification to supply
chain tracking and data sharing, Apollo provides the essential cryptographic infrastructure for Identus platform to
thrive in a connected world demanding unparalleled security and trust.
